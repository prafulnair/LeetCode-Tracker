This problem is essentially about tracking the number of rods that have all three colors (B, G, R) placed on them.

Key Problem Aspects:
1. **Input Structure**: The input string `rings` contains pairs where the first character represents a color ('B', 'G', or 'R') and the second represents a rod (0-9).
2. **Data Storage**: We use a dictionary (`dataMap`) to store the rods (as keys) and the colors placed on them (as values). This is a string concatenation problem where each rod accumulates the colors added to it.
3. **Set Comparison**: After building the dictionary, the goal is to check if the colors associated with each rod contain all three required colors ('B', 'G', 'R'). We achieve this using sets.

**Approach**: 
- It's a **hash map problem** where we store and count specific occurrences of characters (colors) associated with rods.
- The solution uses a **dictionary** to aggregate the colors for each rod, and a **set comparison** to determine if a rod is "good" (i.e., it has all three colors).

**Steps Breakdown**:
1. Parse the string `rings` by iterating through it in pairs.
2. Use a dictionary (`dataMap`) to store rods as keys and their corresponding colors as concatenated string values.
3. Check for rods that contain all three colors ('B', 'G', 'R') using a set comparison.
4. Count and return the number of rods that meet the criteria.

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `rings`.
